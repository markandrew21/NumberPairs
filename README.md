# NumberPairs
This is a code quiz I was given before a C# .NET Software Developer job interview....

We would now like you to solve a basic programming problem.  This should only take a few minutes.  This exercise is to write a C# console application that outputs numbers between 1 and 99 whose first and second digits add up to 10.   The numbers that match the pattern should be output in descending order.  The matches should be output first, each on a separate line. The numbers that donâ€™t add up to 10 should be output on a single, comma-delimited line after the matches.

Requirements & Instructions
 
1. The application must be a .NET console application written in C#.
2. The application should be contained in one .CS file. 
3. The output from the  application must be identical to what is listed in "Sample Output", so pay attention to the format of the expected output.
4. When you have completed the exercise, save the .CS file as "yourname.numberpairs.txt" where "yourname" is your first and last name.   For example your name is John Smith, you would send a file named "johnsmith.numberpairs.txt".  Email the file to name@company.com.
